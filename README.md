# restaurant

demonstration of DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering pages using javascript alone to generate the contents.
- three pages that dynamically load
- information generated via loops and functions instead of hard-coded

future features:
- animate the loading of different pages
- improve styling

learning notes:
- found this one rather unexciting so minimal css design was implemented - functionality was easy to achieve and self-explanatory
